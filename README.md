🛰️ Reliable Data Link Protocol: Go-Back-N Implementation
Project Overview
This project implements a reliable Layer 2 (Data Link) communication protocol using the Go-Back-N (GBN) algorithm. It simulates data transmission over an unreliable channel, handling common network issues such as packet loss, bit errors, and transmission delays.

🛠️ Key Technical Features
Flow Control: Implementation of the Sliding Window mechanism (Go-Back-N).

Error Detection: Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for ensuring data integrity.

Data Transparency: Implementation of Bit-Stuffing to handle frame delimitation.

Unreliable Channel Simulation: Custom environment to simulate real-world network degradation (loss, corruption, latency).

📂 Project Structure
code/

canal.py: Channel simulation (errors, packet loss, delays).

stuffing.py: Functions for Bit-stuffing and CRC calculations.

protocole.py: Core implementation of Sender, Receiver, and test scenarios.

message.txt: Source file used for transmission tests.

rapport.md: Detailed technical report on design choices and test results.

🚀 How to Run
Navigate to the code/ directory.

Run the simulation:

Bash

python protocole.py
The results for 4 different network scenarios will be displayed in the terminal.

The transmitted data will be reconstructed in a file named output.txt.

⚙️ Configuration
Scenarios (error probability, loss rate, and delays) can be adjusted directly in the if __name__ == "__main__": block at the end of protocole.py.
